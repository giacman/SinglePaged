Hi, I'm Giacomo. This is my personal website / portfolio.

I'm a Data Scientist currently working as Analytics Lead in [AKQA](http://www.akqa.com/). I have a Master of Science in Economics and Social Sciences from [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/Graduate+School/MSc+Prospective+Students/Economic+and+Social+Sciences/ECONOMIC+AND+SOCIAL+SCIENCES_EdAuthor+2008+07+07+03+2) University.

Originally from Florence, Italy ‚òÄÔ∏èüç∑ I moved to London ‚òÇÔ∏èüçª {$variable} years ago to work in Digital. 
So far so good, I'm now the proud father of a little Italo-British beautiful girl.


Below you can have a look at some examples of my work and some of the projects I've been working on.
