Hi, I'm Giacomo. 

I currently work as a Data Scientist and Analytics Lead at AKQA in London.

I'm originally from Florence, Italy ☀️🍷 but now I live in London ☂️🍻


I'll post some of my projects in this page. I hope you liked them. If you did let's get in touch,
Also if you didn't we can still have a chat. I'm on Twitter (a lot), or you can reach me on 
my email even give me a call.
